          Jourvel was the first of four projects that I undertook during my
          course at GA. We were paired up with our classmates and were assigned
          to interview our partner about their interests and identify a problem
          that could be solved with the design of a simple mobile application.
          <br /><br />The task was to design an interactive prototype of a
          mobile application for my classmate, Emily.

            As the sole designer on this effort, I worked on this project
            adopting the double diamond design process - from interviewing Emily
            to discovering her interests and pain points to designing a solution to
            help solve her problem.

      <h2>Discover and Define: Understanding Emily</h2>
      <p class="content">
        I started off with getting to know Emily to identify issues in her
        everyday life. I asked her about her daily routines, her interests, what
        she likes to do, and I found out that she loves to travel, and she often
        travels abroad for vacation with friends and families. So I dug deeper
        to learn more about her traveling experiences. I learned that her goal
        was to have an awesome experience and she doesn’t want to miss out a
        place, otherwise she would feel regretful, having travelled all the way
        to the destination. I also discovered that she finds it difficult to log
        her trips’ memories, and over time, it becomes hard for her to refer
        back to it. <br /><br />After the user interview, I laid out all my
        findings into an affinity map to get a clear picture of Emily’s journey
        in detail stages, the actions she take at each stage, and her emotional
        reaction to each stage of the journey.

      </p>
      <div class="content-2">
        For better understanding, I recreated her journey above into an
        experience map. During the interview, she mentioned that her media
        (pictures and videos) are dispersed across multiple platforms, and she
        wants to be able to categorize it according to her experiences. Based on
        those findings, I identified Emily’s problem as

          Emily needs a way to store memories of her vacations in a streamed
          lined process as she can refer to the experience and share/recommend
          it to her friends, unlike going back to her social medias which are
          cluttered with other aspects/activities in her life.

        Develop & Deliver: <br />Solutions to help Emily log her trips in a
        streamlined process.
      </h2>
      <img src="/images/img-casestudies/jourvel/crazy-8.png" alt="Ideation Sketches" class="crazy8" />
      <p class="photo-caption">Ideation Sketches</p>
      <p class="content">
        During the ideation and solution stage, I came up with several ideas
        that could help Emily log her travel memories accordingly and in a
        simple way. Some of the ideas I came up with were similar, but all of
        the ideas revolved around a core concept to compartmentalize Emily’s
        experiences according to her planned expectations of the trips and in a
        simple way. I defined simple as an elimination of the hassle that her
        plans, notes, pictures, and references are stored on several platforms —
        on WhatsApp chats, Instagram, Photos, Notes, and Pages.
        <br /><br />
        As I was ideating some of the initial ideas, I got lost into focusing on
        the “streamlined process” and didn’t give much thought to “simplicity”.
        I thought of a travel log app which acts as a travel diary, an app that
        stores memories in a map form with voice detection so Emily can speak
        about her experience and it would be automatically logged into the
        itinerary. The first five ideas answer the same problem but their forms
        were not simple and easy enough, and it all still seemed to be
        complicated. But the sixth idea was a lightbulb solution, both function
        and form were the exact translations of what I had in mind for the app —
        I thought of creating a travel log app that acts as an all-in-one
        platform that functions live with the camera while she is on her
        travels.
      </p>
      <h3>Taking a step back to look at the big picture</h3>
      <p class="content-2">
        After spending quite a lot of time on ideation, I then took a step back
        to see if the solution fits with the situation. I wrote the outcome
        statement and a storyboard to get a clear picture of how this mobile app
        will help tackle the issue.
      </p>

      />
      <p class="photo-caption">Storyboard of how the app will help Emily</p>
      <p class="content-3">
        After knowing what application I was going to design, I made a user flow
        of how Emily will use the application. This was also to identify the
        screen flow of the app. I then began to design a prototype for the app.

      <!--Section 2: Screen Flow-->
      <p class="content-4">
        Before jumping straight into creating paper prototypes for the app, I
        translated the screen flow into actions that Emily will take by using
        the app. <br /><br />
        The application helps her to: <br /><br />
        1. Create itinerary <br /><br />
        2. Document her trips and compartmentalize it to the itinerary she
        created in 1.<br /><br />
        3. Store all her trip information in one platform — can edit it, refer
        back to it, and share with friends.<br /><br />

          created in 1.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          She has all the information stored in one platform — can edit it,
          refer back to it, and share with friends.

      <!--Section 2: Usability Test-->
      <div class="usability-test">
        <h3>Usability Test</h3>
        <p class="content-5">
          After creating the paper prototype, I uploaded the screens sketches
          onto the marvel app to create a clickable prototype to be used in
          usability testing. For the test, I created a hypothetical situation
          that Emily goes on vacation in Thailand and identified that the
          application has three main tasks. The usability test examined each
          task scenario as follow:
          <br />
          <br />
       <span class="task-scenarios">
          <b>TASK SCENARIO 1:</b> <span class="task">Emily creates an itinerary.</span
          ><br /><br />
          <b>TASK SCENARIO 2:</b>
          <span class="task"
            >She is able to automatically categorize her media according to her
            experiences.</span
          ><br /><br />
          <b>TASK SCENARIO 3:</b>
          <span class="task"
            >She can view/edit/share her travel log with friends.</span
          ><br /><br />
        </span>
          After the test, I learned that there was a gap between my thoughts on
          how Emily would use the app and the way she actually interacts with
          it. I made iterations to the app after observing how Emily interacts
          with the prototype, and how she wants the app to function. I factored
          learnings from the test into the iteration and made the following
          changes to the task scenarios.

              <div class="iteration-body">
                As Emily creates an itinerary, she uses photos found online as
                reference to the destination she is visiting. She wants to be
                able add those photos into her travel plan as references so I
                added a button for her to be able to add media into the
                itinerary manually.

              <div class="iteration-body">
                Emily found it hard to indicate if the app is active or not. I
                created an indication on the homescreen of phone to notify her
                when the app is activated. Initially, TASK 2 ends when she takes
                a photo, but after the test, Emily found that it is convenient
                for her to view the media and updated itinerary right away so
                she can edit it accordingly. Therefore, I added a “view
                itinerary” button on the bottom left corner of the phone’s
                screen for her to be able to access this function. In case the
                user wants to use the camera for other purposes besides updating
                media to their itinerary, they can close the app [a pop-up
                screen on camera] by clicking the “X” button on the top right
                corner. After iteration, I added an eye icon for the user to be
                able bring back the pop-up screen, and they can continue to take
                pictures and compartmentalize their memories into the app.

                The iteration I made to task scenario 3 was integrating this

                go back to the app to view it.
