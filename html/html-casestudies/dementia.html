        The Dementia Friends Champions dashboard is online interface that
        Champions (volunteers) use to do certain tasks related to their role.
        Dementia Friends have seen a decrease in the number of Information
        Sessions that Champions are recording on the dashboard and an increase
        in technical enquiries.
        <br />
        <br />
        The dashboard needs to be redesigned so that Champions can get their
        main tasks completed efficiently, keeping them engaged and increasing
        the number of Sessions they run.

        Dementia Friends Champions are volunteers who deliver Information
        Sessions in their communities to help people learn more about dementia.
        Participants of the information sessions then become a ‘Dementia Friend’

      <h1>Brief</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <span class="heading">Goal: 2.6 million to 4 million by 2020</span
        ><br />
        Dementia Friends is an initiative by Alzheimer’s Society to change the
        way people think, act and talk about dementia so that people affected by
        dementia are treated as equal members of society. Core to this are the
        face-to-face Dementia Friends Information Sessions, run by their
        volunteer Dementia Friends Champions. Since its launch, over 2.6 million
        people have become Dementia Friends, meaning they’ve learnt about how
        dementia affects a person and gone on to take action to help people
        affected by dementia. The initiative has an ambitious target of reaching
        4 million Dementia Friends by 2020.
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <span class="heading">Dashboard’s context of use</span><br />
        The dashboard is Champions’ one-stop shop for everything they need to
        deliver inspiring Information Sessions in their communities and make
        real change for people affected by dementia. The charity has been using
        the dashboard as a tool to connect with their volunteers and to keep up
        with their progress. Volunteers use the dashboard to log the Sessions
        that they are running, tell the program how many Dementia Friends
        they’ve made, access all the resources they use to run their Sessions as
        well as many other functions.
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <span class="heading">The Challenge</span><br />
        However, Dementia Friends have seen a decrease in the number of
        Information Sessions that Champions are recording on the dashboard and
        an increase in technical enquiries. The dashboard needs to be redesigned
        so that Champions can get their main tasks completed efficiently,
        keeping them engaged and increasing the number of Sessions they run.
        <br />
        Dementia Friends gave us a prioritized list of the keys tasks that
        Champions perform on the dashboard. They also detailed that they wanted
        to focus on mobile for the redesign.

    <div class="section-discover">
      <div class="content">
        We started the research phase by immersing ourselves in the whole
        experience of being a Champion,
        <b>attending an Information Session run by a Champion</b>, and running a
        <b>UX audit</b> of the current site. Following this, we interviewed and
        conducted <b>usability testing</b> with 11 Champions, myself leading 2
        of those. As well as delving into their experience as Champions and
        their use of the dashboard, it was also important for us to find out how
        experienced they were with using the dashboard itself - how many
        Sessions they’d run, how long they’d been a Champion for - to understand
        whether proficiency of use might be down to simply learning the
        dashboard over time. <br /><br />
        We used Affinity Mapping to synthesize our research and to help create
        common understanding.<br />
        We discovered 5 main insights:

      <div class="content">
        Before we jumped into designing the dashboard, it was important for us
        to brainstorm ideas with the people who were familiar with the work
        process better than us, we ran a design studio with the client and began
        with presenting our user research findings to get everybody aligned on
        the same page, warmed up the room with some exercises as majority of
        them have never attended a design studio session before, and described
        the opportunity for the design that the group was going to focus on
        using a How Might We statement:

        <h2>Designing with Dementia in Mind</h2>
        <div class="sub-content">
          As we entered the main part of the design phase, we had to make sure
          we designed with Dementia in mind, as some Champions are living with
          Dementia themselves. From the Dementia Digital Design
          Guidelines/Heuristics, there one overarching key takeaway:
        </div>

        <div class="caution">
          <b
            >Iterate designs gradually and judiciously — if it’s working, keep
            it.</b
          ><br />
          Don’t tinker with design necessarily. If it’s working, keep it. Keep
          in mind impaired memory and learnability. Where possible: refine,
          rather than wholly redesign.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-content">
          Our research had shown that experienced Champions had learnt the
          dashboard rather than finding it easy to use. In light of the
          Heuristic above, this became a much starker reality and solidified the
          fact that we had to be judicious in our approach — processes that
          worked, we kept.

          Rapid Prototyping

        We quickly created a paper prototype which included the flows for the
        main tasks, testing with 5 users each time up to mock up level. When
        testing, we gave participants the main tasks to complete.

      <div class="prototype">
        <div class="prototype-text">
          <h4>Homepage</h4>
          We focused on discoverability of the key tasks from the homepage.
          Users had no problems finding each of the tasks, with the majority
          using the large CTAs in the centre of the homepage. However, the
          checklist function was not readily noticed by users, so we had to work
          on this, giving it more real estate on the page, a more checklist like
          structure and bright colours to draw attention to it.

          <h4>Resources</h4>
          The current user flow on the dashboard seems simple (see image below),
          yet when conducting usability testing on the current site, we found
          that in reality users were dipping in and out of different sub
          categories to try and find the resources they were looking for.
          <br />
          User flow for the current Resources section Through our redesign of
          the Resources section, we wanted to give Emma as many ways as possible
          to find the same resource. In our final design, she would land on the
          Session resources homepage, have option of starting with a search,
          filtering by audience, or filtering by resource type, to find the same
          resource.
          <br />
          User flow for the new design of the Resources section Starting with an
          image of the resource to make the section more visual, we iterated to
          a card layout that would allow related resources to sit together. The
          search bar had to be made more prominent as users weren’t noticing it.
          Instead of the folder structure, we created a separate ‘Resources
          type’ filter for this to give Emma more flexibility and added a line
          of copy inviting Emma to use the filters as well as a strong, bold
          colour to guide them towards using them.

          <h4>Report</h4>
          Reporting on a Session is something that is very important for
          Dementia Friends as a charity — without this they have no way of
          knowing how many Dementia Friends there are in total. For this flow,
          we chose to design the mobile screens as this was the task we found in
          our research that Champions would be most open to completing on
          mobile. Currently it is very difficult to find where to report on a
          Session.
          <br />
          Current user flow for Reporting on a Session In our design, we made
          ‘Report on a Session’ a clear CTA. After testing, we added the pop-up
          back in but gave it a clearer, more informative design. Failing that,
          when closed, there would also be a permanent red notification on the
          CTA as a reminder.

          <br />
          <div>
            Our design needed to improve discoverability and efficiency of key
            tasks for the Champions. We achieved this through a clean, simple
            dashboard using a card layout that would be easily responsive to
            tablet and mobile. Designing with dementia in mind, we kept
            processes that worked, and improved upon those that didn’t to enable
            volunteers to get their most important tasks done. With reduced
            friction, Champions will be more engaged and more likely to run more
            Sessions, whilst the Dementia Friends team can focus on other areas
            for growth.

          <div>
            <div>
              From the 2 personas that emerged from user research, we chose to
              design for newer Champions with the hypothesis that learning the
              dashboard is a workaround and a result of bad design and if we
              could nail it for newer Champions, it would also work for those
              more experienced Champions. After 5 usability tests on the final
              prototype with seasoned Champions, their positive feedback
              confirmed our hypothesis that if we could nail it for new
              Champions, the new dashboard would work for seasoned Champions as
              well.
