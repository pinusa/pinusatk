      <div class="content">
        Time Out is a lifestyle magazine that provides entertainment, food,
        drink recommendations to an international audience through print and
        digital media. Time Out inspires and enables people to experience the
        best of the city they’re in, providing original editorial content for
        users to find things to do as well as curated lists of the best films,
        food, attractions, art, culture, shopping and nightlife activities.
        Operating in 108 cities, it has a monthly global audience reach of 242
        million.
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <span class="heading">The Challenge</span><br />
        Time Out understands that to develop their brand and continue their
        success they need to explore and develop new ways of engaging users
        whilst leveraging their current service and the technology in their
        current mobile app, and create a social network based around individuals
        or groups meetings face to face, in real life. The new service would be
        called Team Up and would be introduced in London first, and then the
        rest of the world.

      <div class="content">
        <span class="heading">Client’s request</span><br />

        1. Real time communication between users in the app. <br />
        2. Users should be able to arrange face to face meetings at locations in
        London.<br />
        3. Groups of users should have clear instructions of where to go, and
        how to get there.

          Since the new service targets existing Time Out users, we wanted to
          get more context of users behaviour and find out how the target
          demographic spend their leisure time alone/with friends, find
          recommendations and their behaviour around it. We interviewed
          respondents who read Time Out magazine and we discovered the following
          patterns:
          <ol>
            <li>
              No one uses the Time Out application, even though some are aware
              that it exists.

            <li>
              Recommendations & events are shared with a screenshot or a URL via
              WhatsApp.

            We decided to build a responsive website instead of a native
            application as we learned from our findings that:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Besides surfing the web on desktop, users search for things to
                do on the browser on their phone while they are on the go.

              <li>Time Out readers do not use the Time Out application.</li>

      />
      <p class="photo-caption">Design Studio and User Flow Ideation</p>
      <div class="content">
        Originally, we defined Team Up as a meet up between individuals/groups
        with the goal to help Sami arrange a face-to-face meet up with
        friends/colleagues. After several ideations we still couldn’t settle on
        a design that meets Sami’s need. I realised that our concept definition
        for Team Up was not specific enough — we didn’t know what kind of meet
        ups we were setting for our users. The realisation led me to question:
        <br />
        <span class="design-question"
          >What is the motivation for a person to arrange a meet up with
          somebody?
        </span>
        <br />As a result, we didn’t limit Team Up only to the scenario of
        meeting with friends on the weekend, as users in real-life experience
        several meet up scenarios — drink with friends, dinner with colleagues,
        concert with her clique, or joining a new group with a common interest
        on an activity. People could team up with their friends on any kind of
        occasions. Despite framing a flow around a specific occasion they could
        be in, we created 3 user flows “Share/ Invite/ Join” for Team Up based
        on the aforementioned understanding of the multiple facets to a person’s
        life. As a result, the three tasks have become Team Up’s primary CTA’s
        that initiate a face-to-face meet up.

      <!--<p class="photo-caption">
        Share - Invite - Join — helped define “Team Up” and highlighted the kind
        of meet ups Sami could have.
      </p>-->
      <div class="flow-selection">
        <div class="content">
          Out of the 3 flows we discovered, we decided to focus on the path of
          Share. Our rationale is as follow:
          <br />1. Share is the primary behavioural engagement to how users
          currently interacts with the contents they come across; they share
          post via WhatsApp/Facebook Messenger in the form of a screenshot or
          url. <br />2. Share overlaps with Invite as it initiates an
          invitation.
        </div>

        <img src="/images/img-casestudies/timeout/whatsapp.svg" />
        <div class="content">
          As mentioned earlier that readers share content via WhatsApp.
          Important information to help aid decision making such as date & time,
          venue information, event details and pictures are dispersed among the
          lines of conversation in the chatroom. Users find themselves
          frustrated having to scroll through the chat history to refer back to
          those details. Hence, our concept of Team Up’s Share feature is to
          help elevate users’ sharing process by creating an instant
          gratification for them to engage and meet face to face.

      <!--Visual Design-->
      <div class="visual-design">
        <h3>Visual Design</h3>
        <div class="content">
          After deciding on the design of the new service, we then proceeded to
          work on the visual design. For the visuals, Team Up is a new feature
          introduced as a new way to engage users and to leverage Time Out
          current service, therefore the visuals must be consistent with the
          brand’s current design.

          <div class="heading">How did we solve the problem</div>
          <div class="content">
            Although the client had an intention to build a real time
            communication between users in the Time Out app through the new
            service, our research found that the users’ behaviour of
            communication does not support their idea.
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            Time Out readers are not interested in downloading the application
            since Time Out website is easily accessible on the web. Asking users
            to communicate out of their conventional messaging app would mean
            higher barrier to building engagement (including arranging
            face-to-face meetings) with their friends as it limits sharing only
            to people who use Time Out application.
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            We believe that we are able to integrate real-time communication
            between users by capitalising on readers’ behavioural convention in
            which they use WhatsApp as their main communication platform.
